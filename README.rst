Landscape visualiser (Viewland)
###############################

Source code: https://github.com/andywuy/landscape_visualiser

Documentation: https://andywuy.github.io/landscape_visualiser/

Viewland is a landscape visualiser that can visualise the potential energy surface based on user provided landscape data. 
The program uses the disconnectivity graphs to visualise the high-dimensional landscape surfaces.

The landscape data (min.data and ts.data) can be generated by PATHSAMPLE, which is developed in `Wales' Group <http://www-wales.ch.cam.ac.uk/software.html>`_.

Installation
------------
Install from Github

.. code-block:: text

    git clone https://github.com/andywuy/landscape_visualiser
    cd landscape_visualiser
    docker-compose up -d
    docker-compose run viewland bash

Examples
--------
Use the ``gen_tree.py`` script to create a pdf of the landscape:

1. Put ``diff.map``, ``min.data`` and ``ts.data`` into the ``data\`` folder.     
2. Create ``tinfo`` which is the configuration file for the script in the ``data\`` folder.
3. ``docker-compose run viewland bash``
4. ``export PYTHONPATH=/code/``
5. ``cd /user_data/``
6. ``python /code/scripts/gen_tree.py``
7. ``tree.pdf`` which displays the disconnectivity graph of the landscape will be created.
